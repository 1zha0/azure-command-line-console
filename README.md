# What is about?

It is an interactive console which takes user's command line from the input box, processing on Azure Platform, and returning results back to the browser.

You are able to run many Windows commands in Azure Platform, such as `ver`, `dir`. But not all of them. Some commands, like `format`, `label` and etc., cannot be processed due to privilege setting on Azure Platform. But you can always find some interesting commands to get interesting results back.

With this tool, you are able to look inside Azure, to get better understanding of Azure Platform, and maybe, to find some way to hack the system.
